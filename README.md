# Sklearn
## Sci-kit learn algorithms
Here Logistic regression is used to predict the cancer type(malignant or benign) from the cancer-data dataset available.

Only the data corresponding to the radius_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean and fractal_dimension_mean are used for prediction of diagnosis.

Logistic regression is used because it gives best accuracy among the surveyed algorithms such as SVM,KNN.
